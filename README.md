Doodle Recognizer is a machine learning-powered web application that allows users to draw objects on a canvas based on random prompts. 
The core objective of the model is to accurately classify user-drawn doodles in real-time and determine whether they match the given prompt.
Key Features:

Interactive Drawing Canvas: Users draw doodles within a limited time for each round.

Random Prompts: The app selects objects randomly for the user to draw in each of the six game rounds.

ML-Based Prediction: A trained machine learning model classifies the doodle based on the drawn strokes and matches it against the prompt.

Tech Stack:
Frontend: HTML, JavaScript, Canvas API

Backend/ML: Python, TensorFlow/Keras (or similar), trained on the doodle dataset
Backend(Node): For Leaderboard
